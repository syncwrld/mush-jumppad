## MushJumpPad
Copy of mush.com.br jump pad lobby system, now you can stop of asking it to me in my discord dm

## How to use
Put the jar into your `plugins` folder and restart the server, now you can configure the plugin in `config.yml` file.
To put a new `Jump Pad`, use `/pad` `(permission: pad.admin)` and put the configured block, to remove an existing pad you can make the same steps but breaking the pad block.
